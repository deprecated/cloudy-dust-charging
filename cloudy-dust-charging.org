* Cloudy models of dust grain charging around luminous stars
+ The aim is to find \phi as a function of ionization parameter (and other parameters)
  + Mainly for OB stars, but may also try RSG/AGB case
+ This can then be used to study gas-grain decoupling in bow shocks
* TODO Initial tests
+ [X] Write an input file by hand
  + Start with something from test suite?
  + First attempt is [[file:models/test-dust.in]]
+ [ ] Run it and see what output we need to save
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  export D=~/Work/CLOUDY/cloudy/source
  cd models
  $D/cloudy.exe -p test-dust
  #+END_SRC

* TODO Production runs
+ [ ] Decide which approach to use?
  1. Python script to write multiple input, run with ~make -j 8~
  2. Work out how to use Cloudy grid command (need to install MPI?)
+ Do it
